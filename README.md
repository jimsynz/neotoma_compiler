A mix compiler which adds support for compiling
[Neotoma](https://hex.pm/packages/neotoma) `.peg` files into Erlang source.

## Installation

Add to your dependencies by adding it to the deps in you `mix.exs`. You only
need to add it to your `:dev` and maybe `:test` environments to compile your
parsers for export as part of your mix package.

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    # ...
    {:neotoma_compiler, "~> 0.1.0", only: [:dev, :test], runtime: false},
    # ...
  ]
end
```

Additionally you must add it to your project's compilers:

```elixir
def project do
  [
    # ...
    compilers: compilers(Mix.env())
    # ...
  ]
end

defp compilers(env) when env in [:dev, :test], do: [:neotoma | Mix.compilers()]
defp compilers(_env), do: Mix.compilers()
```

Now any file ending in `.peg` will be compiled into a corresponding `.erl` file
in the same directory.
